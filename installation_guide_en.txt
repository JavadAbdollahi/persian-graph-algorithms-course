To run the Python scripts for this course, you need to install a few libraries. This file will guide you through the simple installation process.

**Prerequisite:**
Ensure that you have Python and its package manager, pip, installed on your system.

**Recommended Method (Install from requirements file):**

1. Open your terminal or Command Prompt in the same directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
2. Enter and run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will automatically install all the libraries listed in the file with compatible versions.

**Alternative Method (Manual Installation):**
If the method above does not work for any reason, you can install the libraries manually one by one with the following command:

pip install networkx matplotlib Pillow
